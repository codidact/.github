### Be nice; be respectful

We are deliberately not spelling out everything that is and is not allowed - bring
your own common sense and apply the spirit of this Code. The following things are
_definitely_ not okay:

 * Rudeness
 * Threatening, abusive, or prejudicial treatment of a person or group
 * _Ad hominem_ attacks, whether directed at individual people or groups
 * Any kind of harassment, for any reason

Always be constructive, especially when giving feedback. Always presume that others
are acting with good intent.

If you see anything that appears to be a violation of this Code, flag it or email us 
at info@codidact.org. We take reports seriously, and although we may not be able to
follow up with you, we will take any necessary action. We'll keep your identity private.
