## Community Code of Conduct

The current Codidact community code of conduct may be found
[here](https://github.com/codidact/core/wiki/Codidact-Code-of-Conduct).
It is in the process of being transcribed to this repository to serve
as a master record of the official policies and procedures for interacting
with and amongst the Codidact community.

## Contribution Guidelines

The current contribution guidelines may be found
[here](https://github.com/codidact/core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md),
but unfortunately they are not as visible as would be ideal, and the Core
project is the only project to which the guidelines are currently being
displayed when contributors open new issues and pull requests.

For that reason, this repository will serve as the home of the official
Codidact community contribution guidelines.

## Security Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines

Critical security vulnerabilities must be reported quickly and discretely
to ensure mitigations are put in place as expeditiously as possible while
a patch is developed upstream. We are committed to providing a clear
channel of communication to allow security researchers and developers to
report potential vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

While our current technology stack has been defined, our project is still
in its nascency, and a concrete security is thus being developed in step
with a formal organizational hierarchy.

Updates to the project security policy will be made public as soon as they
are available.
